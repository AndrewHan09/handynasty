      <h1>Hi, for those who dont know me my name is Andrew Han.</h1>
       <h1>I moved from Fujian,China, to San Diego in 2015.</h1>
       <h1>Though ironic and contradicting, I personally am a very energetic yet pessimistic person</h1>
       <h1>Now I'm in Wrestling and Deca, a business club, hoping to reach states in both areas.</h1>
       <h1>Business is my future career, no matter how difficult it may seem I will assert my dominance</h1>
       <h1>But overall, the biggest joy of my life is to eat food!!!!</h1>

      <h1>Day N-- Finished my Android APP Today</h1>
       <img src="/My_website/images/Tic tac toe MIT inventor.jpg" height="450">
        <h1>The Game starts runing when you press the Start button
        and it is a multiplayer game-2 people.
        And they will just press X or O when it is their turn,
       however, if 3 consecutive in a row that player wins.</h1>
       <h1>My project was Tic-Tac-Toe, 
       and surprisingly it was an success as all the functions ran perfectly.
       But in the future as a team we could make the project better by adding into more complex functions 
       that will modify the background of the home screen, 
       and maybe shift the button around into a bouncing link.
       However, even though my project was perfectly fine,
       I do not think that it can be sold as a project,
       why? Well because there is already similar apps out there 
       and those apps sought to be more complex and fun 
       since those inventors had more time into thinking and developing their Tic-Tac-Toe.</h1>

	      <h1>A detective sought to seek after and capture a monster his entire life, 
	      a serial killer, head of the purple scythe organization,  that leaves the victim's 
	      (female prostitutes that are in trouble with the law)
	      blood in the shape of a scythe and a poker card on the corpse and the cards increase by kill,

	      And afterward, under the request of the police department of Manchester, he goes to another city
	      ----------- this time with the knowledge of being a serial killer...</h1>
