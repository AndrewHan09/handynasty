        <h1>There was this one time,
        I kinda screwed up by going out to eat sushi late at night on a school day, forgetting that I just froze my card due to anonymous transactions.
        So at midnight I had to call Sam to come all the way over to come save my ass-------Basicly Pay off my debt. 
        The problem was that he doesnt drive and I cant leave and get him, resulting in my bro having to get a uber at 11pm, coming over and pay off my 100$ debt</h1>
